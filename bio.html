	    <h3>Artist Bio</h3>

	    <p>
	      Iris Warchall is a self-taught painter and lifelong art lover.
	      Iris is currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area, and as
	      a child lived in North Texas and near Washington, DC.  She has
	      also been a practicing physical therapist since 2013. During
	      the COVID-19 pandemic, Iris found herself seeking ways to keep
	      her four-year old daughter entertained and stimulated while their
	      typical haunts of the playground and library were closed. The two
	      began to spend much more time drawing and painting, and Iris was
	      reminded of the joy she found in creating art and inspired to
	      spend more time pursuing her lifelong interest in the visual arts.
	    </p>

	    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>

	    <p>
	      Much of my painting is inspired by the Color Field and Abstract
	      Expressionism movements. I am of course influenced by my
	      experiences as a woman, a mother, a healthcare provider, and a
	      resident of the complicated place that is the United States. In my
	      art, as well as in all other domains of my life, I constantly am
	      seeking new ways to look at things.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      I find joy in balancing the movement, texture, composition, and
	      color in a piece. To me, the process presents itself as a
	      pleasurable problem to be solved each time. My education and
	      professional experience have driven me to have a strong interest
	      in the human brain, and particularly the science of perception.
	      Painting is a way for me to explore the subtleties of visual and
	      tactile perception and how they relate to our impressions of the
	      world around us.
	    </p>
